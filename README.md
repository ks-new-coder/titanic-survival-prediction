🌊 Titanic Survival Prediction — Project Summary
📌 1. Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to predict which passengers were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster using information such as age, gender, and passenger class.

📌 2. About the Dataset
The dataset contains real information about the Titanic passengers.

Important columns:

Survived: 1 = survived, 0 = died

Sex: male or female

Pclass: passenger class (1 = highest, 3 = lowest)

Age: age of the passenger

Fare: ticket price

Embarked: port where the passenger boarded the ship

📌 3. Steps I Performed

Loaded the dataset

Checked missing values

Filled missing Age and embarked

Dropped Cabin (too many missing values)

Did EDA (exploratory data analysis)

Created Age groups

Created Fare groups

Visualized survival patterns

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Checked accuracy and performance

📌 4. Key Findings

Women survived more than men

1st class passengers survived more than 3rd class

Children survived more than adults

Passengers with higher fares had better chances

The male + 3rd class had the lowest survival rate

📌 5. Machine Learning Model

I used Logistic Regression, which is good for binary predictions (0 or 1).

📌 6. Model Performance

Accuracy: ~80%

Good at predicting both those who survived and not survive

Overall, a good basic model

📌 7. Final Conclusion

This project helped me learn how to:

clean data

analyze data

build a basic machine learning model

Check model accuracy

The model showed that gender, class, and age had a strong effect on survival.
This completes my first ML project.

Project Completed!
